                    <p>Soccer also has advanced rules that help referees control the game. One of the most important is the offside rule, which prevents players from gaining an unfair advantage by staying close to the opponent’s goal.</p> <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
                    <p>Other advanced rules include fouls, free kicks, throw-ins, corner kicks, and penalty kicks. These rules ensure fair play and help organize the game in different situations.</p> <!-- Paragraph 2 -->

                    <ol> <!-- Ordered list -->
                        <li>Direct free kick – awarded for major fouls</li>
                        <li>Indirect free kick – awarded for minor infractions</li>
                        <li>Penalty kick – awarded when a foul occurs inside the penalty area</li>
